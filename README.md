In this project, analysis of e-commerce customer behavior is the core focus. Understanding customer behavior in an e-commerce environment is crucial for businesses because it can help them better meet customer needs, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and thereby improve overall performance.

The main goals are:

Analyze customer behavior: Understand customer behavior patterns on e-commerce platforms.
Predict customer churn: Identify key factors that may lead to customer churn.
Make improvement suggestions: Based on the analysis results, make strategic suggestions to enhance customer loyalty.

Tools and Applications
1. Talend Data Integration
Integrate different data sources: Data in e-commerce environments are often scattered across different systems, such as sales records, customer interactions, product information, etc. Talend Data Integration is used to extract data from these disparate data sources and integrate them into a unified data warehouse.
Ensure data consistency: For analytical accuracy, it is crucial to ensure data is consistent across sources. This tool helps achieve this.


2. Talend Data Preparation

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a critical step in any data analysis project. With this tool, you clean your data, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure the quality and reliability of your data.
Optimize data structure: Adjust data structure to facilitate analysis, such as converting data types, creating derived variables, etc.

3. SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS e-Miner)
Build predictive models: SAS e-Miner is used to build and test a variety of data mining models, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models. These models help learn from historical data and predict future customer behavior.
Model evaluation and selection: You compare between different models and choose the one that best explains and predicts customer behavior. This involves considering the accuracy, interpretability and complexity of the model.


Results and Impact:
Customer behavior insights: Through analysis, you identify key factors that affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, such as purchase frequency, average consumption amount, product preferences, etc.
Application of predictive models: The built models not only help predict the likelihood of customer churn, but also provide directions for action to prevent customer churn.
Strategy recommendations: Based on the analysis results, you can make specific business strategy recommendations, such as personalized marketing, customer loyalty programs, and customized services for specific customer groups.
Overall, your case study demonstrates how data mining and analytics can be used to improve customer understanding and service effectiveness of e-commerce platforms, which is critical to improving customer satisfaction and business performance.
